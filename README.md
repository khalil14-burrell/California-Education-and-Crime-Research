Crime and Education Statistics Correlation Analysis for California Counties
This project analyzes the relationship between crime and education statistics across all counties in California. Using publicly available data sources, this study gathers county-level information on various crime metrics and educational attainment levels. A correlation analysis is then conducted in a Jupyter Notebook to identify any significant relationships between crime rates and education levels.

# Project Overview
- Data Collection: Crime and education statistics were collected for each county in California. Sources include official government databases and other reputable public datasets.
- Data Processing: Data was cleaned, standardized, and organized to ensure consistency across counties.
- Correlation Analysis: Using Python, we performed statistical analysis to explore the correlations between different crime rates (e.g., violent crime, property crime) and educational attainment indicators (e.g., high school graduation rate, college degree attainment).
- Visualization: Correlation results are presented with visualizations to make patterns and relationships easier to interpret.
# Key Features
- Collection of crime and education data for all counties in California
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for accurate analysis
- Statistical correlation analysis using Python libraries
- Visualization of findings to illustrate relationships between education and crime rates
# Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization
- SciPy for statistical analysis
#Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis and explore the data. This project can be used as a foundation for further research into socioeconomic factors and their relationships with crime rates across regions.
